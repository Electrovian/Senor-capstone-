# Professional Biography

My name is **Mitchell Koski**, and I am a 22-year-old senior Computer Science major at the University of Cincinnati. I enjoy coding as both a career path and a hobby, and in my free time I like to go fishing as a way to recharge. Academically, I am finishing out my senior year with a focus on **cloud systems**, **embedded systems**, and **AI safety**. One of my long-term career goals is to gain a full-stack understanding of computing—from the low-level operations of the CPU up to the high-level software systems that power modern applications.  

I am building a professional portfolio that reflects this journey, with projects spanning cloud infrastructure, embedded programming, and systems design. My vision is to become a versatile engineer who can bridge the gap between hardware and software, while contributing to the development of reliable, safe, and scalable technologies.

## Project Sought
For my senior capstone project, I am focusing on **developing a website to support the 3D print lab at the University of Cincinnati**. The site will serve as a central hub for managing the lab’s 30+ printers, streamlining administrative tasks, and improving access for students and staff.  

This project combines my interests in **cloud infrastructure, backend/frontend integration, and embedded workflows**, while also having a direct and lasting impact on the university community. I aim to not only deliver a functional solution but also set up a sustainable platform that future students can build upon.
